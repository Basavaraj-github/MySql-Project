# MySql-Project
This repository showcases two MySQL-based database projects:

Online Book Store – Manages books, orders, and customer data.

Pizza Sales Analysis – Tracks pizza sales performance using advanced SQL queries.

Both projects use MySQL Workbench for database management, with CSV file imports and structured queries ranging from basic to advanced.
